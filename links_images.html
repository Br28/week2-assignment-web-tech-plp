    <!-- A brief description of life -->
    <p>
      Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes,
      such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does
      not, and is defined descriptively by the capacity for homeostasis,
      organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and
      reproduction. Many philosophical definitions of living systems have been
      proposed, such as self-organizing systems. Viruses in particular make
      definition difficult as they replicate only in host cells. Life exists all
      over the Earth in air, water, and soil, with many ecosystems forming the
      biosphere. Some of these are harsh environments occupied only by
      extremophiles.

      Living things are composed of biochemical molecules, formed mainly from a
      few core chemical elements. All living things contain two types of large
      molecule, proteins and nucleic acids, the latter usually both DNA and RNA:
      these carry the information needed by each species, including the
      instructions to make each type of protein. The proteins, in turn, serve as
      the machinery which carries out the many chemical processes of life. The
      cell is the structural and functional unit of life. Smaller organisms,
      including prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), consist of small single
      cells. Larger organisms, mainly eukaryotes, can consist of single cells or
      may be multicellular with more complex structure. Life is only known to
      exist on Earth but extraterrestrial life is thought probable. Artificial
      life is being simulated and explored by scientists and engineers.
