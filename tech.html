      Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge for achieving
      practical goals, especially in a reproducible way. The word technology can
      also mean the products resulting from such efforts, including both
      tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as
      software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and
      everyday life. Technological advancements have led to significant changes
      in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during
      prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to
      the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the
      Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater
      travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent
      technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the
      Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the
      knowledge economy. While technology contributes to economic development
      and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like
      pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like
      technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, there
      are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of
      technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides.
