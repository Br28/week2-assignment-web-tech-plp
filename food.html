      Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains
      nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of
      body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide
      the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is measured in
      units called calories. Age, sex, weight, height, and level of activity
      determine the number of calories a person needs each day. Depending on
      age, sex, and activity level, the recommended daily caloric intake for a
      child aged 11 to 14 can range anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 calories per
      day, with sedentary girls needing the fewest calories and active boys
      needing the most. For adults, this can range from 1,800 to about 3,000.

      Scientists divide nutrients into six major groups: carbohydrates, fats,
      proteins, minerals, vitamins, and water. Most foods contain all or most
      nutrient groups, in different amounts. Carbohydrates provide energy for
      the body. Nearly all the carbohydrates we eat come from plants. They
      include starches found in cereal grains and plants like potatoes and yams.
      Sugars, found in fruits, vegetables, and milk, are also carbohydrates.
      Sugarcane and sugar beets are grown specifically for their high sugar
      content. Many of the starches and sugars we eat have been processed into
      products, such as flour and corn syrup. These processed carbohydrates are
      used in cookies, cakes, breads, pastas, and pies. Fats provide more than
      twice as much energy as carbohydrates. They also help protect and insulate
      the body and its internal organs. Common fats include vegetable oils, such
      as soybean, cottonseed, and corn oil. They are used in cooking and in the
      processing of many foods. Fats that come from animal products include
      butter and lard. Eggs, milk, cheese, meats, poultry, and fish also contain
      high levels of fats. Proteins are the body’s chief tissue-builders. They
      help keep skin, bones, muscles, and blood healthy. Proteins also help
      regulate bodily processes, including transporting oxygen and nutrients
      into and out of cells; the clotting of blood; and the formation of
      antibodies, which help fight disease. Animal products, such as beef, fish,
      poultry, eggs, and dairy products, are high in protein. Grains, nuts, and
      some beans are also protein-rich foods. Minerals and vitamins are called
      micronutrients because they are needed in very small quantities compared
      with carbohydrates, fats, and proteins (known as macronutrients). Minerals
      provide building materials for the body and help regulate its activities,
      much as proteins do. Calcium and phosphorus build strong bones and teeth,
      iron contributes to healthy blood, and iodine helps keep the thyroid gland
      working. Vitamins help the body make full use of other nutrients by
      assisting the chemical reactions that make those nutrients work.
